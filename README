T - Distribution
T-distribution is any member of a family of continuous probability distributions that arise when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and the population's standard deviation is unknown.
The submitted file contains a javascript file, a HTML file and a CSS file.
HTML file is used for the basic skeleton of the webpage and add heading, slider etc.
Javascript file:
	a. A function called as create is defined which is used to create the graph taking data as the input.
	b. Various elemts of the graph is determined later in the function such as defining a border,  X-axis, SVG object, Y-axis and finally plotting the line.
	c. The density function of a T-distribution contains a Gamma function, thus a Function called Gamma is defined so that it can be used in the formula of density function.
	d. Next another function called Plot is defined which is used to plot the Graph and in this function Create function is called.
	e. In the Plot function a function called Point is defined which return the Y coordinate for the given x-coordinate using density function of t-distribution.
	f. The final part consists of slider which runs when the input is given (Degrees of Freedom) and Plot function is called int it.
CSS file consists of various stylings added to webpage and Graph to make it more attractive.
Run the HTML file on live server to view the T-distribution.
